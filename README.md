### iqbalyarkhan.github.io

This is a site built with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) using [gatsby-starter-julia](https://github.com/niklasmtj/gatsby-starter-julia). To get started:

```bash
npm install
npm run develop
```

#### Start Developing

Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

```sh
cd blog
gatsby develop
```

#### Deploy to Github Pages

To deploy to github pages, simply do the following:

- Ensure that your `package.json` file correctly reflects where this repo lives
- Change the `pathPrefix` in your `config.js`
- Run the standard deploy command

```sh
npm run deploy
```


#### Access Locally
You can see your changes live in your local every time you save by:
```
$ cd [REPO_NAME]
$ gastby develop
```
and navigating to http://localhost:8000

To develop locally, make necessary changes then:
```
$ gatsby build
$ gatsby serve
```
Your project would be running locally. Once satisfied with your changes, push to your
github branch and once merged with master, run:
```
$ npm run deploy
```



#### What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”. A short description of what you can find there is below.👨🏻‍💻

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser. For example is the **Nunito** typeface imported here.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

#### The src directory

    .
    ├── components
    ├── content
    ├── images
    ├── pages
    └── templates

1. **`/components`**: Your React components can be defined here. You can include them from there in your pages.

2. **`/content`**: The filesystem plugin is configured to get the `*.md` files from here. These will be published on the `/blog` page.

3. **`/images`**: This directory is the home for your images that you can query via GraphQL since the filesystem plugin publish them there.

4. **`/pages`**: Here is where your pages like `/blog`, `/about` and also the 404 page lives. An example of the basic structure can be found above.

5. **`/templates`**: You will find the `blog-post.js` template there which defines how every blog-post page is structured.
